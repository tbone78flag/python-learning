Learning to code with Python

# Python Learning Journey
This repository tracks my progress through LinkedIn Learning's *Python for Beginners* course (2024 edition).  
All projects are done locally in VS Code and versioned through GitHub to show real learning progress over time.

## Topics Covered
- Basic syntax and variables  
- Functions and conditionals  
- Loops and lists  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Small project challenges

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This
I wanted to practice Python in a real development environment (VS Code + Git/GitHub) rather than a web sandbox, to simulate professional workflows.
